			<h2><b>sone:</b> a proposal for the new digital music community and a call for participation in existing alternatives</h2>
			<p>sone is a template for a new kind of <em>participative</em> music community: openly available to others to contribute to, co-own, collaborate within, replicate, experiment with, or build into something else altogether. sone is a self-organized, self-governing community of creators, fans, and <em>participants</em> working together to publish and build. </p>
			<p>more specifically, sone is a

					<b>D</b>ecentralized <b>A</b>utonomous <b>O</b>rganization&mdash;it&rsquo;s fancy jargon for a digital co-op, basically.
					</span>
					</span>
				</wow-tooltip>. sone uses a token which requires a crypto wallet to utilize. sone is born of a &ldquo;web3&rdquo; ideology, wherein creators aren't beholden to platforms. we know those last few sentences are daunting and possibly a turn off if you're new or unfamiliar with this corner of the internet, but that's why we&rsquo;re here: to facilitate conversation, answer questions, help navigate, and ultimately collaborate on the creation of useful and wonderful things together in this new digital zone.</p>
			<p class="callout">we&rsquo;ve started sone as a small group of people with backgrounds in music and DIY, coalescing around ideas of what a creative community can be in the context of a new internet. our hope is that sone will grow into a diverse, vibrant, and sustaining place for creative people all over. our primary goal is to introduce and rollout our own initiatives and to try to make the web3
				 space more approachable in general. along the way, we intend to publish our process, resources, general musings, and calls to action with a focus on a more equitable, transparent, collaborative, and sustainable future (and present!) for creatives overall. 
				<br><br>if this is exciting to you, if you have ideas for collaboration, or you simply want to follow along, we invite you to <a href="https://discord.gg/QyKYEeFTbv" target="_blank">join our Discord</a> where we&rsquo;re just starting to get things off the ground now.
			</p>
			<p>by participating in sone, you help shape what it is and <em>who</em> it is. when you publish with us, you earn $SONE (our community token, which grants access to a growing eco-system of tools) and

			<h2><b>tone:</b> the Discord bot that pays artists for streams</h2>
			<p><b>tone</b> offers streaming audio from Soundcloud and Bandcamp and keeps track of plays in aggregate and on a server-by-server basis. this allows us to pay out equitable, transparent, percentage-based payments to artists. the bot has monthly subscription tiers based on usage which cover hosting costs, 10% platform fees paid out to SoundCloud and Bandcamp, a 10% fee sone takes to fund our treasury, and payments made to artists in CELO to verified artist wallets. all artist wallet addresses also receive $SONE upon getting verified, which grants access to the DAO and a growing eco-system of tools funded by our treasury.</p>
			<p>we&rsquo;re looking for ways to extend the functionality of the bot, further integrate it into other existing services, and to harness what we&rsquo;ve learned to continue to build out other useful tools for artists and creatives.</p>
