			<h2><b>participation</b> as a means of building equity in the communities we contribute to.</h2>
			<p>the way the web currently works, our online activity creates value for the platforms we engage with, but we aren&rsquo;t privy to a cut of it. moreover, our data is mined to generate revenue for platforms. we participate, but get nothing for it. web3 changes this, centering the individual over the platform.</p>
			<p>at sone, we&rsquo;re aiming to distill the altruism that underpins initiatives like Bandcamp Friday and apply it to <em>every</em> day, as a new paradigm for how we support creative endeavors. with this new paradigm, we eschew fans and followers who create value but don&rsquo;t receive it, for <em>participants</em> who do. by investing our collective attention in co-ops, web3 ethos, and open protocols/platforms that embrace this new paradigm, we can build a better model for music and countless other niches. </p>
			<p>we all want to support creators in sustainable ways now more than ever, but we recognize that the experience to do so needs to be viable and frictionless, and the incentive to do so compelling enough to leave what already &ldquo;works&rdquo;. alternatives to silo&rsquo;d platforms exist <strong>all the time now</strong> though, not ~the far off future~, not just the first Friday of the month, and not at a fixed .00X per stream (now with ~payola!). it&rsquo;s here now and is whatever we make it!! </p>
			<p>sone is a group of individuals from different backgrounds, geographies, and experiences all coming together to <em>participate</em> in creating art, publishing words, and building useful tools for creators. we are using our modest platform to rally our peers in music and beyond to reconsider what it is to <em>participate</em> online. there are many ways to participate with sone&mdash;all of which are malleable, fluid, and non-mutually exclusive:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>generally, as a participant.</b> by default, everyone is a participant. participants collectively curate the community&rsquo;s output both granularly and at a high level. participants also vote on decisions that guide sone&rsquo;s direction. by participating, you earn $SONE, our community token that grants you access to various tools and resources, and serves as equity in sone itself.</li>
				<li><b>as a creator&mdash;animators, illustrators, poets, musicians, writers, etc..</b> creators can make pitches to the community for what they&rsquo;d like to create, and other participants decide on whether or not sone should fund their ideas.</li>
				<li><b>as a builder&mdash;programmers, designers, developers, copywriters, etc..</b> builders create tools and protocols for the greater public good. builders can also make pitches to the community for what they&rsquo;d like to build, and other participants decide on whether or not sone should fund their ideas.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>the above are a few of the more obvious roles within sone, but there are endless ways to participate, and certainly ways we haven&rsquo;t considered yet (maybe you have?). We&rsquo;re just getting started here, and we understand that a lot of what we&rsquo;re proposing might be hard to grasp initially. if you&rsquo;re more of a visual learner, or just need more of a primer, here are some useful links to check out:</p>
