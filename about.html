			<h2><b>sone:</b> a proposal for the new digital music community and a call for participation in existing alternatives</h2>
			<p class="callout">what if the work of a few individuals at a record label could be split up amongst many members of a supportive community surrounding an artist instead? what if that community then shared in the success of the artists they advocated for? what if that community and the artists they embraced were able to create <em>together</em> until everyone&rsquo;s collective participation blurred the lines between creator and consumer altogether? what if that community could sustain an ecosystem that rewarded everyone&rsquo;s continued participation within it? what if that then evolved to become something altogether different?&mdash;incubating ideas, launching new projects, funding new initiatives, providing mutual aid, collaborating with other online communities&mdash;these are just a small fraction of the [now former] hypotheticals that are becoming viable ways to <strong>participate</strong> in modern online music communities <em>right now</em>.
				<br><br>this is the first in a series of posts we&rsquo;ll be publishing to highlight exciting potential use cases (like those above), to introduce and rollout our own initiatives, and to try to make this space more approachable for our fellow artists, labels, and beyond. 
				<br><br><strong>our initial goal is to explore what a record label can be in the context of a new internet. we intend to publish our process, resources, general musings, and calls to action for the independent music community with a focus on a more equitable, transparent, collaborative, and sustainable future for music overall. </strong>
				<br><br>if this is exciting to you, if you have ideas for collaboration, or you simply want to follow along, we invite you to <a href="https://discord.gg/QyKYEeFTbv" target="_blank">join our Discord</a> where we&rsquo;re just starting to get things off the ground now.
			</p>
			<p>recently, we&rsquo;ve been inspired and motivated by emerging crypto-adjacent co-operatively minded tools. we know a lot of you reading this are understandably allergic to and ready to tune out from anything having to do with crypto, but as many of our peers <a href="https://ampled.mirror.xyz/BtZXGcoYn0K-xThCDxLEQGhGJXsj11tQVT6rtMGaGLw" target="_blank">have</a> <a href="https://leavingrecords.mirror.xyz/PHJ-Z8DkEjBwLZrJBrdzTCoVh0iAoYoye8Aoi1Fy1OM" target="_blank">pointed</a> <a href="" target="_blank">out</a>, we think it&rsquo;s finally time to take a good look at all of this and assess how it can <strong>serve us.</strong> our reasons for excitement are rooted outside of the press hype of

				</span>
				</span>
				</wow-tooltip>, surging speculation in meme coins, and the general wider embracing of cryptocurrencies by established institutions (and the all-time-high price$ that come with all that). we see the value in utility.</p>
			<p>our mindset changed completely when we first heard the term &ldquo;web3&rdquo; earlier this year. we kinda scoffed at it initially, but in sitting with it, one is made to consider what the defining characteristics of our current moment of &ldquo;web 2&rdquo; even are <small>[insert lengthy, convoluted Rites of Spring ---> Fall Out Boy ---> 5th wave analogy here]</small>. it&rsquo;s spawned a lot of useful stuff, but even well-intentioned endeavors succumb to the flaws of a flawed environment. like, we don&rsquo;t think anyone reading this thinks it&rsquo;s necessarily a good thing that everything we post online is walled off by four behemoth, centralized, private corporations. or that just three companies comprise over half of the worldwide cloud computing market. or that you know exactly what we mean when we say &ldquo;you are the product&rdquo;. or, just, simply that &ldquo;the like economy&rdquo; is a phrase that exists because of it.</p>
			<p>it's yet to be seen how those large scale issues will be dealt with, yet despite the juvenile stage of web3 platforms and protocols by comparison, the overarching principles and ethos are clearly defined by fundamentally different premises in truly empowering and exciting ways. we won&rsquo;t go into <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/" target="_blank">the underpinnings of it all,</a> but to us, web3 feels like a re-acquainting with original visions for the internet. there&rsquo;s a remarkable array of <a href="https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1413850349803384838" target="_blank">possibilities</a> in web3:

				Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
				</span>
				</span>
				</wow-tooltip>, social tokens, digital co-ops, and beyond. we sincerely think the future of vibrant, sustaining, and truly independent music communities will live (and thrive!) in these crypto-adjacent spaces, but we collectively need to normalize and de-stigmatize what that is and can be.
			</p>
			<p>at this point, we definitely need to qualify the rest of this in saying this isn&rsquo;t some sort of manifesto or whatever—many, many people are already building incredibly useful, decentralized, and innovative tools in this new environment. frankly, none of the ideas we&rsquo;re presenting are all that groundbreaking tbh. it&rsquo;s just that we don&rsquo;t think the music communities we&rsquo;re privy to—which stand to most benefit from all of this—are even paying attention to it. so we are up on our digital soapbox, trying to rally our peers and anyone who will listen: we should be looking at this space much more as we believe it is the path toward a more equitable, transparent, and sustainable future for music. this is all being built <strong>right now.</strong> the platforms of web 2 don&rsquo;t serve us because we&rsquo;re not the beneficiaries of their value and had no voice in shaping them. the protocols of web3 represent a new horizon and an opportunity to correct that. we can have a say in how and help shape what the future of the internet looks like by choosing to <em>participate.</em></p>
			<p>for our part, we want to explore what this can be for a record label. a record label is ostensibly a music community, and so our hope is we can create something of a template for a new kind of <em>participative</em> music community, making it openly available to others to contribute to, co-own, collaborate within, replicate, experiment with, and fork into something else altogether on their own should they want to. these are the tools of organized, self-governing communities of creators, fans, and <em>participants</em> in the new internet and we need to embrace them!</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong>a quick aside:</strong> we know we&rsquo;re hella vague and pie-in-the-sky so far here. so we&rsquo;ll start to shift this to more concrete ideas in a moment. those ideas are very much still forming! we are excited! we have things we want to build! protocols we want to utilize! new models we want to employ! we still have a <em>ton</em> to learn along the way though, and if you&rsquo;re excited about all of this and feel similarly, we want to <a href="https://discord.gg/QyKYEeFTbv" target="_blank">connect with you!</a></p>
			<p>we are massively inspired by labels starting out more recently under a collective/co-op model like <a href="https://www.moonphysics.com/" target="_blank">MOON PHYSICS</a> and <a href="https://www.grimalkinrecords.com/join" target="_blank">Grimalkin</a>, by decentralized streaming services like <a href="https://audius.co/" target="_blank">Audius</a> and <a href="https://nina.market/" target="_blank">Nina</a>, by streaming co-ops like <a href="https://resonate.is/" target="_blank">Resonate</a>, by the sheer joy of unique listening experiences like <a href="https://openlab.fm/" target="_blank">OpenLab</a> and <a href="https://loft.radio/" target="_blank">loft.radio</a>, and even by failed endeavors like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCGoknGiDNRum1TusJ3UX9g/about" target="_blank">po.et</a> or <a href="https://ujomusic.com/" target="_blank">Ujo</a>—this is all partly inspired by them. technically, Topshelf Records is itself a privately owned LLC. if we were starting the label today, we&rsquo;d go a different route. we&rsquo;ve always said we have completely no fuckin&rsquo; idea what we&rsquo;re doing and that will continue indefinitely lol, but we&rsquo;ll learn as we go. this is the next chapter of that.</p>
			<p>//// still working on:</p>
			<p>&ldquo;a call for participation in existing alternatives&rdquo; is in the headline. for me, in addition to some web3 stuff that has sprung up (most of which is still too exclusive/insider-only to call for people to sign up for tbh), this is:</p>
